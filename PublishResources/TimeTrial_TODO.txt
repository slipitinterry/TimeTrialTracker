Feature Requests
=================

From Harry L:

1)  Necessary: We can have more than one rider crossing the line at the same
time.  I think I've seen as many as three.
    1a)  We do sometimes get the number wrong as the rider approaches.  I don't
recall (can look at recording sheets for erasures) if we have ever changed the
rider number AFTER recording.  But some kind of ability to either change the
number OR just record the error occurred with the correct number is necessary.

2)  Desirable: While I can enter the times into the spread sheet from the phone
screen, is it possible to create a file (CSV or tab delimited: "Number, time" is
sufficient)?

3)  Desirable: Is it possible to display the lap (number of previous entries for
a number)?  I realize that right now the code is just recording the number and
time and this addition may take a lot more code.  This is something we can't
(easily) do now and is in the "it would be nice" category.

From Scott Francks:

The screen I envision displays at least 5 rows showing number, lap and estimated time of arrival.
Each of the numbers (or entire row) is a hot spot for hacking
The list is dynamically sorted by ETA, then number (keeps order on first lap)

Any of the visible riders can be hacked.
Once hacked, a time record is written, lap is incremented, the rider gets a new ETA and drops off screen to the appropriate place on the list.
It would be cool if the displayed ETA would count down.

What I haven't figured out yet is how to keep visible, the next rider to start, when riders begin lapping before all have started. A loop is needed to ensure the next rider to start is always shown at the top of the screen list.
